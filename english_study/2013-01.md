If you use PyMongo, 10gen's official MongoDB driver for Python, I want to ensure you understand how it manages sockets and threads, and I want to brag about performance improvements in PyMongo 2.2, which we plan to release next week.

- improvements : 提高，改进

Each PyMongo Connection object includes a connection pool (a pool of sockets) to minimize the cost of reconnecting. If you do two operations (e.g., two find()s) on a Connection, it creates a socket for the first find(), then reuses that socket for the second.

- minimize: 最小化

When sockets are returned to the pool, the pool checks if it has more than max_pool_size spare sockets, and if so, it closes the extra sockets. By default max_pool_size is 10.

- extra: 额外的

What if multiple Python threads share a Connection? A possible implementation would be for each thread to get a random socket from the pool when needed, and return it when done. But consider the following code. It updates a count of visitors to a web page, then displays the number of visitors on that web page including this visit:

- implementation: 方法，实现方法
- consider：考虑
- visitors：访问者

Since PyMongo defaults to unsafe writes—that is, it does not ask the server to acknowledge its inserts and updates—it will send the update message to the server and then instantly send the find_one, then await the result. If PyMongo gave out sockets to threads at random, then the following sequence could occur:

- Since: 因为
- acknowledge: 承认，告知收到
- instantly: 立即
- gave out: 公布，发表
- occur: 发生

This thread gets a socket, which I'll call socket 1, from the pool.
The thread sends the update message to MongoDB on socket 1. The thread does not ask for nor await a response.
The thread returns socket 1 to the pool.
The thread asks for a socket again, and gets a different one: socket 2.
The thread sends the find_one message to MongoDB on socket 2.
MongoDB happens to read from socket 2 first, and executes the find_one.
Finally, MongoDB reads the update message from socket 1 and executes it.

- executes:执行

In this case, the count displayed to the visitor wouldn't include this visit.

I know what you're thinking: just do the find_one first, add one to it, and display it to the user. Then send the update to MongoDB to increment the counter. Or use findAndModify to update the counter and get its new value in one round trip. Those are great solutions, but then I would have no excuse to explain requests to you.

- trip: 旅程
- excuse: 成为...的理由，原谅
- explain: 说明，阐明，解释

Maybe you're thinking of a different fix: use update(safe=True). That would work, as well, with the added advantage that you'd know if the update failed, for example because MongoDB's disk is full, or you violated a unique index. But a safe update comes with a latency cost: you must send the update, wait for the acknowledgement, then send the find_one and wait for the response. In a tight loop the extra latency is significant.

- advantage: 优点，长处，优势
- violated: 违反
- latency: 潜伏，潜在
- tight: 紧密的
- significant: 重大的，有意义的

PyMongo solves this problem by automatically assigning a socket to each thread, when the thread first requests one. The socket is stored in a thread-local variable within the connection pool. Since MongoDB processes messages on any single socket in order, using a single socket per thread guarantees that in our example code, update is processed before find_one, so find_one's result includes the current visit.

- solves: 解释，说明
- automatically: 自动
